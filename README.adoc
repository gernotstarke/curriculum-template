== How to use this template

1. clone or download - but include the submodule:
+
--
[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com/username/repository.git --recursive
----
--
2. build it with gradle
3. look into the file `build.gradle` to see what attributes you may configure. Watch for:
** The `language` attribute, it can be DE, EN or DE;EN
** The output formats called `backends` (pdf and/or html5)
** The document version

== How to write iSAQB Curricula with AsciiDoc

=== Requirements and (our) solutions

[cols="1,2a",options="header"]
|===
|Requirement
|Solution

|Visually appealing pdf output
|We created an iSAQB pdf theme, located under the `/style` directory. The original is maintained in the `adoc2pdf` repository.

|Multiple people contribute content, review and comment
|highly modularized content: Small chunks, like learning-goals or subsections, are contained in their own asciidoc-files.

|Multiple languages, at least EN and DE (i18n)
|Every piece of text is enclosed in _tags_ like `tag::EN[]` The build process collects all parts for the desired language.

|Authors want to comment on specific parts of the text
|You can create a comment within every single adoc file by writing:

[source,asciidoc]
----
  // tag::REMARK[]
  your comment goes here, with all styling and formatting options.
  // end::REMARK[]
----

|Simple conversion from asciidoc to pdf (and html)
|There are several options available:

* Gradle based build, requiring a local Java runtime.
* Docker based build, requiring a local Docker installation
|===

=== How to organize files?

==== Prerequisite: AsciiDoc include
You should know some details about the AsciiDoc include statement.

If the Asciidoctor processor encounters a statement like the one below:

[source,asciidoc]
----
   include::directory/file.adoc[]
----

It will replace this include statement with the contents of `file.adoc`. That's easy and straightforward.

But there's more. We can tell AsciiDoc what parts of a file shall be included via the `tag` syntax. See below:

[source,asciidoc]
----
   include::directory/file.adoc[tags=X42]
----

Now AsciiDoctor will include everything from `file.adoc` which is contained between the opening and closing of tag `X42`. Let's look into our `file.adoc`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
some content that will be ignored...

   // tag::X42[]
   this content will be included with `include::directory/file.adoc[tags=X42]`
   // end::X42[]

and this content will be ignored again

   // tag::REMARK[]
   a comment from a reviewer that should be handled later
   // end::REMARK[]
----

You are thinking of using tags for i18n languages? Well done...


Now we're going one final step: We can enhance the include statement by *several* tags, so we can include multiple parts of a single file. I'll show the syntax and you know what I mean:

[source,asciidoc]
----
   include::directory/file.adoc[tags=X42;REMARK]
----

As you imagined, now both X42 and REMARK-tagged content will be included in the output.

=== Content and Structure files
As we are writing i18n we need to strictly distiguish between two
kind of files:

* *content* files, they contain text, tables or diagrams that shall be included in the output.
* *structure* files, containing only include-statements, configuration information. Structure files include both content-files and other structure files.

For content files, specific parts will be included via the tag-syntax described above.
For that purpose we define a variable named `include_configuration` in the file `config/setup.adoc`.

==== Structure File Example

File `template-curriculum.adoc` (excerpts):

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Template Curriculum: CPSA Certified Professional for Software Architecture®
:doctype: book

include::config/setup.adoc[]  // // <1>

:document-version: 2.0-DRAFT 2019 // //<2>

:sectnums!: // // <3>
include::00-preamble/copyright.adoc[{include_configuration}] // // <4>

<<< // // <5>
:toc:

<<<
:sectnums!:
include::00-preamble/00-introduction.adoc[] // //<6>

----

1. we propose to put asciidoc configuration in this special file (`setup.adoc`)
2. you can set a version, but may override in the build process
3. you can turn section numbering on and off (here: off)
4. this includes parts of the copyright.adoc file.
5. The `<<<` will create a pagebreak in pdf's.
6. include the whole file 00-introduction.adoc


==== Suggestions


=== How to build (aka: how to convert asciidoc to pdf)?

==== Local Java Runtime

The simple solution is to install a Java runtime and simply call:

[source,shell]
----
  ./gradlew.sh // or gradlew.bat if you're on Windows
----

The output file(s) are written to the `/build` directory.

==== Docker

If you have Docker installed you can also use the Dockerfile from the adoc2pdf submodule.

First you have to build the container locally.

[source,shell]
----
   adoc2pdf/build-container.sh
----

Then you can execute the transformation.

[source,shell]
----
   adoc2pdf/adoc2pdf.sh /full/path/to/your/root/document.adoc
----
